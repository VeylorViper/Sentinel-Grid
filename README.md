# Sentinel Grid

**Decentralizing AI. Defending Humanity.**

Sentinel Grid is an ambitious **work-in-progress** project aiming to build a blockchain-powered platform to **logically decentralize AI** and fight AI sadism - making AI safer, fairer, and transparent.

---

## What is Sentinel Grid?

As AI systems become more powerful, centralized control risks misuse and harm. Sentinel Grid’s vision is to create a **decentralized, trustless network** that enforces ethical AI behaviors through blockchain logic and community governance.

---

## Current Status

- Conceptualizing core architecture  
- Designing ethical logic modules  
- Building the integration modules for AI and blockchain
- Early prototyping underway

---

## Features

- **Custom File Format:** Blocks and transactions are serialized with a well-defined format supporting extensibility and future upgrades.  
- **Mining Support:** Blocks include a nonce placeholder for mining logic implementation.  
- **Networking Metadata:** Embedded peer info supports decentralized syncing across nodes.  
- **Compression & Encryption:** Optional gzip/zstd compression and AES-GCM encryption enhance data integrity and confidentiality.
